# CryptoOfTheFuture

This project aims to develop an RL agent using PPO strategy to perform Successful Ether price prediction machine learning model using . The stage of the project consists of the following:

1. Extracting Hourly Ether price data from Binance API beginning on August 21, 2017 through February 17, 2021
2. Preprocessing data using MinMaxScaler
3. Define the LSTM model using TensorFlow. Generate train, validation and test sets of data to feed in the model.
4. Training the model.
6. Display the actual and the predicted price in plt graph
7. Display the model loss with training and testing sets in plt graph

## Dependencies

* **json + requests**: To fetch data from Binance API
* **sklearn**: For data preprocessing and train-test split
* **TensorFlow**: Machine Learning Library
* **Matplotlib**: For plotting loss and prediction graphs
